#Add your own folder here

Add yourself to the roster by creating a pull request.

Your PR should come from a *branch* on your own *fork* of this repo. The PR should contain a folder with your name on it.

Inside your folder should be a single readme.md file that contains some basic info about you, nicely formatted in MarkDown. Include your GitHub username, linked to your GitHub profile. Also link to your Twitter account, your LinkedIn page, a favorite photo, and any other relvant background information or online presence you'd like to share with your classmates.

I have created an example folder [here](https://github.com/codefellows/sea-b26-foundations/tree/master/roster/Brook%20Riggio).
