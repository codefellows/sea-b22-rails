If something defines me today is that I am in the midsts of change.

Born 5,300 miles away in Spain, and recently transplanted to Seattle. 
With a background in finance, now reorienting my career towards coding.
I am fascinated with technology and the way it materializes in practical ideas.

I am looking forward to learn and experience how developing teams work together!
