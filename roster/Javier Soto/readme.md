If something defines me today, it is that I am in the midsts of change.

Until recently I lived 5,300 miles away, in Spain, and only recently I relocated to Seattle. 
With a background in finance, I am now steering my career towards coding.
I am easily fascinated with technology and the way it materializes in practical ideas.

I am looking forward to learn and experience how developing teams work together!
